                  Our team was presented with a vision of a website for “Gjøl
                  Kro” from it’s owner Peter in his Client brief. They had no
                  website till then, so the task was to create responsive and
                  accessible website which can be accessed from all types of
                  screens and screen sizes, projects all of Peters visions and
                  visually/functionally reflects restaurants image.

                  For project development we chose agile method. User research
                  process consisted of user-categorization, interviews,
                  interview analyzing and thematizing. With the results we were
                  able to categorize user needs. Having information
                  architecture, we started prototyping - designing low-fidelity
                  prototypes and eventually high-fidelity prototypes.

                  After user testing the prototypes, we got to coding and
                  finished the product. My role in this project was mainly
                  working with user-research, designing and overall help to
                  finish the project in given time. In a month me and my truly
                  talented were able to create requirement checked and
                  sophisticated website for newly opened restaurant.

                  In this assignment we had free choice of project. We decided
                  to go more artistic way choosing to create portfolio. We found
                  a local artist who was in a need for portfolio and a great
                  help for us in this project. We did three user tests including
                  user-research with quantitative and qualitative so that we
                  could see this project from all angles.

                  After gathering loads of data about artist portfolios and our
                  artist we were able to make structure for data, from which we
                  started to create many iterations of wireframes and
                  prototypes. 5-second test was used to prove our design. My
                  main role in this project was to help gather user-research and
                  help with design and sites content.

                  This was one of the most fun projects I have taken part of.
                  With a lot of work and enthusiasm we were able to create a
                  website for musician. On the website we have included
                  discography, gallery, contacts, about me and home page - we
                  also created identity & branding which was made from gathered
                  user research. Duration - 1 month.

                  Using Design-thinking method me and my group was challenged
                  with a task to come up and create two connected platform ideas
                  for "food sustainability in Denmark", so we decided to create
                  App and info screen. This info screen is designed for large
                  screens to be able display live tracking numbers. Data areas
                  are meant to be customizable.

                  enthusiast website which would cover many aspects of cycling,
                  trips, bikes comparison, tips & tricks etc. We built this
                  prototype using OOUX/ORCA methods, User research and thinking
                  about design psychology. The website mainly worked as all

                  "food sustainability in Denmark". As we needed to connect both
                  platforms, we decided that Info screen’s information could
                  also be displayed on a section within the app. User would be
                  able to see his own food-waste statistics and overall
